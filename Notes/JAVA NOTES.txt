what is difference between object code & byte code:

=> Objective code:
 -> The compiled code generated from C/C++ programs is known as Objective 			Code
 -> while objective code generation operating system is participated, 				because of this Object code is platfrom dependent code.
 -> cannot exectue on cross platfroms

=> Byte Code:
 -> the compiled code gerated from java program is known as byte code
 -> while byte code generation operating system is not participated,
		because of this byte code is platform independent
 -> can be executed on cross platfrom in which JVM is available




How to dowload JDK 

-> open google -> search 'JDK download' -> open the website from oracle
 - select preferred version & OS -> Click the link based on your choice

step to create Environment:

-> after Installing the product(JDK XX)
-> go to the product location(where you have installed)
	C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-18.0.1.1

-> open 'bin' folder & copy the path upto bin folder
	C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-18.0.1.1\bin

-> search for system properties-> Select Environment variables

-> select path -> edit -> paste your bin path
-> create path -> paste bin path

to verify:
-> open Command Prompt -> set the path user info
-> use the command  java -version

you have to get result:

java version "18.0.1.1" 2022-04-22
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 18.0.1.1+2-6)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 18.0.1.1+2-6, mixed mode, sharing)



Class: 
-> class is an structured layout which is used to generate object.
-> class holds varibles, methods, blocks, contructors and main method

keyword:  class 

syntax: 

class Class_name
{
  //varibles
  //method
  //constructors
  //blocks
  // main method
} 

Note: 
->Java project should contain atleast one class
->First letter of class name should be capital

main method:
-> executor of program

syntax: 
	-> public static void main(String args[])
      {
			//statements
		}


class Class_name{

	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		
	}

}


Library :
 -> it is a collection of packages
 package: 
	-> it is a collection of classes & interfaces
   class
  	 -> is collection variables,methods,.....




	System.out.println() -> gives output & moves to console to nextline
	System.out.print()   -> given output & console will be in same line
  	System.out.printf()  -> derived from C program


class Class_name{

	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		System.out.println();
	}

}

Datatypes:
->The keywords which provides infomation that, What type of data can be stored in variables!

Variables : 
 -> Name of memories
	rules:
	-> variables can't start with numbers
 	-> it can aplha numeric
	-> only special charecter can be used is '_'(Underscore)
	-> Variables can't be name on keywords(reserved words)

Type of Datatypes:
	-> Primitive Datatypes - we can store only one value
	-> Non primitive Datatypes -we can store multiples values

	=>Primitive Datatypes:
		->Integer Datatypes
		->Float DataTypes
		->Charecter Datatypes
		->Boolean Datatypes
		
		=> Integer Datatypes:
			->the non decimal numbers are known as Integer data's
			
			=>byte       1 byte   - multimedia purposes
			=>short		  2 bytes  - multimedia purposes
			=>int			  4 bytes  - normal programming purpose (upto 9 digts)
			=>long       8 bytes  - it is used to mobile num, aadhar (more than 9 digits)

			datatype  variable_name =  data;
				int 	num  = 111;
				long num2 = 123L  or 123l;
			=> in java, we need to assign  L or l  in the RHS of long value declaration
			=> default data type is int 
			=> default values is 0

		=> Float Datatypes:
			-> the decimal numbers are known as Float data's
			
			=> float    4 bytes - 6 decimal - normal programming purposes
			=> double   8 bytes - 15 decimal-when you want to have more precision values

				float var = 126.58f or 126.58F;
				double var = 7851.574;
			=> in java, we need to assign F or f in the rhs of float value declaration	
			=> deafult datatype is double
			=> default values is 0.0
		
		=> charecter datatype:
			-> the data which are represent in single quotes are known as charecters
			-> keyword : char - 2 bytes - default - '\u0000'
		
				char ch = 'A';
			-> UNICODE system ->  
						
						char    			ASCII
						A - Z				65-90
						a - z				97-122
						0 - 9				48-57
						\0(Null) 		  0

		=> Boolean datatype:
			-> it is used to store true or false
			
			-> boolean  -> 1bit -> false

	-> byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean

Non Primitive Datatypes: 
	-> class
	-> Array
	-> interface
	


Write an program to calculate Total salary of an employee based on Basic sal.

bsal = 12500
totalsal = HRA + TA + bal

HRA = 15% bsal
TA = 17% bsal

O/p:

Total sal: 



							
																			
			
%d
%.2f -> format specifiers -> 


Calculate percentage based on 6 subjects, and round up 2 decimals
